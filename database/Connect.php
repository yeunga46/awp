// NOTE: this file has a password, and so should not be world-readable.
// Usually it would be mode 600, with a ACL permitting the webserver in.  
// But it's like this because you have to use it as sample code.

// YOURS should also have ME listed on the ACL so I can read it without

// NOTE 2: this file is _not_ installed by the Makefile!
// It stays right here in the source_html directory.  Thus there's
