Your project is to build a social networking photo upload site.

It must have all of the following features:

1) User registration.

   a) Users register with an email address.

   b) Users can recover their passwords via an email link.

   c) Users can change their passwords.

   d) Passwords are never stored in plain text.


2) Upload of pictures.

   a) Uploaded pictures are tagged with date/time of upload.

   b) Each picture can be given a caption.

   c) Registered users can comment on uploaded pictures.
       i. Users can delete their own comments.
      ii. Owners of pictures can delete any comment made on a picture.
     iii. Comments are tagged with the date/time.   

   d) Uploaded pictures go into the filesystem, not the database!
      Captions and comments go in the database.
   

3) Consistency.

   a) If a picture is deleted, all comments on the picture are also
      deleted.

   b) If an account is deleted, comments made by that account remain
      but instead of the username they are marked with "[deleted]".

   c) If an account is deleted, all pictures posted by that account
      are deleted.


Extra Credit Ideas:

1) Block a user from seeing/commenting on your pictures.

2) Add hashtags to picture captions/comments and make that searchable.

3) Add "albums" where people can group pictures together.

4) Something you think up yourself.  Impress me.

5) Verify new registrations with an email sent to the given address
   that has a confirmation link, and the confirmation link must be
   followed in order for the registration to be completed.  (Might
   want to add a Boolean field "verified" or something to the user
   table, which verified users have more privileges than non-verified
   users.)
